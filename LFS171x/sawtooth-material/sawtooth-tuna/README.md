## Hyperledger Sawtooth Sample Application - Hyperledger Sawtooth Tuna Chain

We will be looking at a sample blockchain application that interfaces with Hyperledger Sawtooth. This example is meant to introduce you to writing an application that interfaces with Hyperledger Sawtooth as opposed to creating a complete production implementation.

This is an example of a simple Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain application written in JavaScript. Hyperledger Sawtooth Tuna Chain allows a user to create named assets (tuna fish) and transfer them between different holders designated by a public key.

This application was written by Zac Delventhal maintainer on Hyperledger Sawtooth. Original source code can be found here (https://github.com/delventhalz/transfer-chain-js).

**NOTE**

This example is based on v0.8 of Hyperledger Sawtooth. Please refer to the [v0.8 documentation](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/0.8/) when working with this example.
