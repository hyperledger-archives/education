# Welcome & Introduction

## Welcome to LFS171x
Discover the power of business blockchains and distributed ledger technologies with an overview of Hyperledger and introductions to its key frameworks. Blockchains have quickly gained popularity in several industries. This introductory course is carefully curated for both nontechnical and technical audiences. It examines blockchains for the enterprise and a number of pertinent use cases. Hyperledger is a group of open source blockchain-based projects organized by The Linux Foundation. Industries are researching how blockchains may increase efficiency and solve business problems associated with data privacy, security, information sharing, and inclusion. What are blockchain & distributed ledger technologies and how might they impact global business?

The course covers key features of blockchain technologies and the differentiators between various types of Hyperledger blockchain frameworks. We shall start with ‘What is blockchain?’ and open the discussion on where blockchain technology is suitable for your business requirements. We then take a deep dive into the enterprise-ready Hyperledger blockchain frameworks by guiding students through a demonstrated scenario.

Students with a technical background should be able to perform clean installations of Hyperledger Sawtooth and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as, develop simple applications on top of these frameworks. They will gain an understanding of various types of blockchains and which one is most suitable for any particular project.

Students with a business background should gain an understanding of how blockchains work and how they can create value for their business through cost savings and efficiencies in terms of speed and simplicity. They will view how information is generated, stored, and shared in various blockchains, as well as, gain tools to evaluate whether or not a blockchain solution would be suitable for their particular business case.

## Before You Begin
If you are using edX for the first time, we strongly encourage you to start by taking a free 'how to use edX' course that the team at edX has made available. [Click here](https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038) to register and you will be on your way. You will find the edX platform simple and intuitive. You can use the *Table of Contents* under the **Course** tab to navigate between *Chapters* and *Sections*. Once you are in a chapter/section, you can use the ribbon at the top of the screen to navigate the units within that *Section* or *Chapter*. You can always go back to the *Table of Contents* by clicking on the *Course* in the ribbon.

This course is self-paced, meaning there is no structured instructor availability. However, you will find the Discussion board (see the **Discussion** tab at the top of each page) to be very helpful, as a means of asking or answering questions and interacting with your peers taking the course. The Discussion board is moderated by The Linux Foundation.

For any technical issues with the edX platform (including login problems and issues with the Verified Certificate), please use the *Support* icon located on the right side of your screen.

## Syllabus and Grading
The outline for this course can be downloaded [here](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/f78e55f0cfc90346abab4ae5096007d2/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017+type@asset+block/LFS171x_-_Blockchain_for_Business_-_An_Introduction_to_Hyperledger_Technologies_Outline.pdf). Since this course is entirely self-paced, we include demos and questions to help you practice the skills as you are acquiring them. At the end of each chapter, you will have a set of graded knowledge check questions, that are meant to further check your understanding of the material presented. The grades obtained by answering these knowledge check questions will represent 20% of your final grade.

At the end of the course, you are required to pass a final exam, which consists of 30 questions. The remaining 80% of your final grade is represented by the score obtained in the final exam.

<ins>**In order to complete this course with a passing grade, you must obtain a passing score (Knowledge Check and Final Exam) of minimum 70%.**</ins>

![Passing grade](../images/welcome-intro/70_percent_passing_grade.jpg)

You will have a maximum of 2 attempts to answer each knowledge check and exam question (other than true/false answers, in which case, you have only 1 attempt). The knowledge check questions and the exam questions are open book (meaning that you are free to reference your notes, screens from the course, etc.), and there is no time limit on how long you can spend on a question. You can always skip a question and come back to it later.

**Getting your Certificate of Completion**

If you are enrolled in a Verified track, Verified Certificates of completion are available once you achieve a passing score on the final exam. Once you have earned an overall grade of 70% or higher, you will be able to request your certificate directly from your Progress page. Once the request is completed (which may take up to 48 hours), you can then return to the same place and download your certificate. There are no certificates available for Audit tracks.

## Course Timing
This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material.

![Timing](../images/welcome-intro/time-624686_640.jpg)

## Course Progress & Completion
The goal of this course is to introduce you to the concept of Hyperledger technology. In order to check your understanding of the content, you will be asked to answer the Knowledge Check questions located at the end of each chapter and participate in the Final Exam.

The Knowledge Check questions are graded, and, as such, they do count towards your final passing grade (they represent 20% of your final grade). The Final Exam represents 80% of your passing grade. Once you complete the exam, you will want to know if you have passed. You will be able to see your completion status using the *Progress* tab at the top of your screen, which will clearly indicate whether or not you have achieved a passing score. Click [here](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/89830391ed822d4d3a3dfd33b4250dbc/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017+type@asset+block/LFS171x-Progress_Bar.png) to view a sample of this screen in a new tab.

Certificates of completion (Verified Certificates) are available once you achieve a passing score of 70% on your course. Once you have done so, you can request the certificate on your *Progress* page. Once the request is completed (which may take up to 48 hours), you can then return to the same place and download your certificate. The visuals below provide a guide to what this will look like.

## A Note from the Authors
The idea for this course blossomed from a lively conversation between Brian Behlendorf, Robert Schwentker, and Jeff Flowers at the Hackfest in San Francisco, February 2017, about creating a Hyperledger MOOC for edX.

We adopted a personalized, multi-disciplinary approach to teaching blockchain business and technical content, while bringing key people within the Hyperledger Community to the fore. There were many people who contributed to this initial release of the course. First of all, we would like to thank The Linux Foundation Hyperledger project team, especially Tracy Kuhrt, David Huseby, Flavia Cioanca, and Clyde Seepersad, for multiple reviews, detailed suggestions, and everything they did to make this course a reality.

We are grateful to Jeff Flowers, who helped curate the architecture of the course, by sharing his erudite approach to MOOC development. Jeff created a challenging level set with the technical chapters, providing mentorship, and sharing insights into the methodology for setting up and configuring Hyperledger Sawtooth.

We are equally grateful to everyone who worked behind-the-scenes, and to the experts featured in the course videos - whom you will meet in each chapter. We would like to thank Jonathan Levi for his guidance and responsiveness to our business and technical questions.

We would also like to acknowledge key contributions made by Shorouq Aljohani towards the early drafts of the technical chapter on Hyperledger Iroha. She created foundational content for the chapter, drawing from her technical expertise.

Finally, we would also like to thank the masters of the craft, Jefree Anderson and Ted Hoppe, who produced the dozens of videos featured throughout the course. Lillian Chan graciously helped with the video content, and provided fantastic support on set.

And to Brian Behlendorf himself, who believed we could make it happen.

We hope you will enjoy the course and may your learning journey be fruitful!

Sincerely,

Robert, Alexandra, Arianna, Navroop & Nathalie
